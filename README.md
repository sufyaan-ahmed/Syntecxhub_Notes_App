# Syntecxhub_Notes_App
This project is developed as part of Internship Task-1, where one project was required to be completed from the given options.
I chose to build a Notes Application using React (Vite).

The app allows users to add, edit, and delete notes with a clean and simple user interface.
React Hooks such as useState, useRef, and useEffect are used for state management, input focus handling, and data persistence.
Notes are stored in localStorage, ensuring data remains saved even after refreshing the page.

This project demonstrates a basic understanding of React fundamentals, component-based architecture, and modern front-end development practices.
